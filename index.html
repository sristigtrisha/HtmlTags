    <h1>The audio element</h1>

    <p>Click on the play button to play a sound:</p>

    <audio controls>
        <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

    <h1>The b element</h1>

    <p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>

    <h1>The base element</h1>

    <p><img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman"> - Notice that we have only specified a
        relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look
        for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".</p>

    <p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no
        target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>

    <h1>The bdi element</h1>

    <p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest. If the bdi element is not
        supported in the browser, the username of the Arabic user would confuse the text (the bidirectional algorithm
        would put the colon and the number "90" next to the word "User" rather than next to the word "points").</p>

    <ul>
        <li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
        <li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
        <li>User <bdi>إيان</bdi>: 90 points</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The bdo element</h1>

    <p>This paragraph will go left-to-right.</p>
    <p><bdo dir="rtl">This paragraph will go right-to-left.</bdo></p>

    <p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>
    <p class="ex1">This is a bigger paragraph.</p>
    <p class="ex2">This is a much bigger paragraph.</p>

    <h1>The blockquote element</h1>
